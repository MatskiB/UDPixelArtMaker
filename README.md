# UDPixelArtMaker
Pixel Art Maker project for Udacity's Intro to Programming course

This is a simple Pixel Art Maker that allows you to create a canvas grid of maximum dimensions 40x40 pixels. You can use the color picker to choose a desired color and let your imagination go wild. 

Few notes:
- Choosing the grid size and clicking submit will create a new canvas
- Clicking submit again will erase the old canvas and create a new blank one, even if some cells were already filled in
